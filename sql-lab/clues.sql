-- Clue #1: We recently got word that someone fitting Carmen Sandiego's description has been
-- traveling through Southern Europe. She's most likely traveling someplace where she won't be noticed,
-- so find the least populated country in Southern Europe, and we'll start looking for her there.

-- Write SQL query here
SELECT *
FROM country
WHERE region='Southern Europe'
ORDER BY population;
-- Query Top Response: Holy See (Vatican City State)

-- Clue #2: Now that we're here, we have insight that Carmen was seen attending language classes in
-- this country's officially recognized language. Check our databases and find out what language is
-- spoken in this country, so we can call in a translator to work with you.

-- Write SQL query here
SELECT code, name, region, population, language
FROM country
    LEFT JOIN countrylanguage ON country.code=countrylanguage.countrycode
WHERE region='Southern Europe'
ORDER BY population;
-- Same Top Query Response as above.

-- Clue #3: We have new news on the classes Carmen attended – our gumshoes tell us she's moved on
-- to a different country, a country where people speak only the language she was learning. Find out which
-- nearby country speaks nothing but that language.

-- Write SQL query here
SELECT code, name, population, percentage
FROM country
    LEFT JOIN countrylanguage ON country.code=countrylanguage.countrycode
WHERE region='Southern Europe' AND language='Italian' AND percentage='100'
ORDER BY population;
--Query Top Response: SMR | San Marino | 27000 | 100


-- Clue #4: We're booking the first flight out – maybe we've actually got a chance to catch her this time.
-- There are only two cities she could be flying to in the country. One is named the same as the country – that
-- would be too obvious. We're following our gut on this one; find out what other city in that country she might
-- be flying to.

-- Write SQL query here
SELECT *
FROM country
    LEFT JOIN countrylanguage ON country.code=countrylanguage.countrycode
WHERE region='Southern Europe' AND language='Italian' AND percentage='100' AND name=localname
ORDER BY population;
-- Same Top Query Response as above.

-- Clue #5: Oh no, she pulled a switch – there are two cities with very similar names, but in totally different
-- parts of the globe! She's headed to South America as we speak; go find a city whose name is like the one we were
-- headed to, but doesn't end the same. Find out the city, and do another search for what country it's in. Hurry!

-- Write SQL query here
SELECT *
FROM country
    LEFT JOIN countrylanguage ON country.code=countrylanguage.countrycode
WHERE region='South America' AND language='Italian'
ORDER BY population;
-- Query Top Response: Argentina or Brazil

-- Clue #6: We're close! Our South American agent says she just got a taxi at the airport, and is headed towards
-- the capital! Look up the country's capital, and get there pronto! Send us the name of where you're headed and we'll
-- follow right behind you!

-- Write SQL query here


-- Clue #7: She knows we're on to her – her taxi dropped her off at the international airport, and she beat us to
-- the boarding gates. We have one chance to catch her, we just have to know where she's heading and beat her to the
-- landing dock. Lucky for us, she's getting cocky. She left us a note (below), and I'm sure she thinks she's very clever, but
-- if we can crack it, we can finally put her where she belongs – behind bars.


--               Our playdate of late has been unusually fun –
--               As an agent, I'll say, you've been a joy to outrun.
--               And while the food here is great, and the people – so nice!
--               I need a little more sunshine with my slice of life.
--               So I'm off to add one to the population I find
--               In a city of ninety-one thousand and now, eighty five.


-- We're counting on you, gumshoe. Find out where she's headed, send us the info, and we'll be sure to meet her at the gates with bells on.
